<h1 align="center"><b>fsp</b></h1>
fsp stands for flask static pages.

It's a versatile, small, simple, slightly stubborn, and scuffed site generator written in python.

fsp can be used to write websites with markdown, without having to write **too much** html.

fsp provides two ways to run sites: it can build static websites, or it can also run dynamic websites!

![Version: Beta, no official release yet](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-beta%2C_no_official_release_yet-blue)
<hr />

**note: this is still in beta. lots of changes will be made. please help contribute to this!**

*another note: an official release isn't out yet. For development purposes, I've been just adding main.py to my env/libs/python/site-packages (in a virtual environment) folder in a folder called fsp, with \_\_init.py\_\_ and \_\_main.py\_\_ linking to the main.py file. more detailed info below.*

Dependencies:
- python
- python-markdown `pip install markdown`
- flask `pip install flask`
- tomli `pip install tomli`

## Installation / Deployment
fsp doesn't officially have a package yet as I'm still working on this (pls contribute pls) and will be making lots of more changes, I think.

But, if you'd like to check it out, you can do one of two things:

Note: This is assuming that you can make python virtual environments and have git.

1. You could `git pull` this repo to your machine (or just download main.py, but you won't be able to have updates)
   
   Then install the requirements.txt, and simply run main.py every time you want to use fsp.
   
   You could git pull every so often if you'd like to use the latest features.
   
   *( this is the method I'd use as I don't see a purpose of using a proper wsgi server this early on in the development of this project )*
   
   *( just my opinion, though )*
   
3. Or, you could do another much more convoluted option, if you want to run a proper wsgi server:
   
   First, I'd make a virtual environment, and activate it.
   
   Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source ./env/bin/activate
   ```
    
   Windows (powershell):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv env
   ./env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
   ```
   
   
   Then, I'd pull this project from github.
   
   ```bash
   git init
   git pull https://github.com/Tejas-Bh/fsp.git
   ```

   Then, I'd install the things from earlier in this README or from requirements.txt.

   Then, I'd do something weird. I'd go in the virtual environment directory (in my case it'd be `env`), and i'd go inside the lib folder, I'd find the site-packages directory.

   Then, I'd make a new folder: `fsp`

   Then, go inside of it, and make a symbolic link for an \_\_init\_\_.py \_\_main\_\_.py to main.py in the root directory (where you pulled this project).

   Then, I'd continuously git pull every so often since before official release is out, there wil be a lot of changes.

   example for linux:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd env/lib/python*/site-packages/
   mkdir fsp
   cd fsp
   ln -s ../../../../../main.py ./__init__.py
   ln -s ../../../../../main.py ./__main__.py
   ```

   That's it!

To run a server with your app, just the fsp program in the root directory without any command line arguments.
This will start a flask server on `localhost:5000`.

To build the app into a static site, run fsp in the root directory of the app with the command line argument `build`.
This will make a folder called `build/`, which will contain the site.
```bash
python3 -m fsp build
```

If you ever want to deploy your app to a wsgi server like gunicorn or waitress, you can do:
```bash
gunicorn fsp:app
```
or
```bash
waitress fsp:app
```

To import the app into a python script, do `from fsp import app`.

## The Basics

here's the file structure for an fsp project:
```bash
.
├── config.toml
├── content
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── page1.md
│   ├── page2.md
│   ├── page3.md
│   ├── page4.md
│   └── page5.md
├── scripts.py
├── static
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── pikachu.png # You can obviously have subfolders for different file types if you'd like!
└── templates
    ├── base.html
    └── error.html
```

to run an fsp app dynamically, simply run the fsp program from the root of your app.

## Configuration

fsp sites are configured by the `config.toml` file.
config.toml can be used in the templates.

**Example config.toml file**:
```toml
# title of the website
site_title = "My website"

# error template html file in templates/
error_template = "error.html"

# am I using scripts? yes.
scripts_usage = true
```
The parameters from `config.toml` can be accessed through the `fsp` variable.

**Example config.toml usage in template**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>{{ fsp["site_title"] }}</title>
</head>
```

### Built-in parameters
At the moment there's only one built-in parameter in the config file, called `error_template`.
This file allows you to have a separate template for error pages, located in the `templates/` directory.
```toml
# in config.toml
error_template = "error.html" # talking about templates/error.html
```

## Built-in Functions and tools
These are functions and variables which you can use in your markdown and html templates.


**fsp (dictionary)** - like I mentioned earlier, fsp is a dictionary which has all of the things in your config.toml file.

**link_to() (function)** - this is **important to know!** This function is what you'd use to access different urls/sites in your project.
Example:
```markdown
# This is an example markdown page.
Below is a link to another page in my site.

[Hello World]( {{ link_to("/about") }} )
```

**static() (function)** - this is **important to know!** This function allows you to access files in the static folder.
**example:**
```markdown
# Hello World!
This is an example markdown page.

Now, below is an image using static().
![pikachu]({{ static("pikachu.png") }})
```

**md_metadata (dictionary/only for templates)** - metadata for markdown files.

Example:
```markdown
---
title: Welcome to my website!
date: 10-10-10
---
```
and then in your template, these can be accessed by:
```html
{{ md_metadata["title"] }}
{{ md_metadata["date"] }}
```

**md (object/only for templates)** - the rest of the information by using the markdown library if you want to use it

**body (string/only for templates)** - **THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE!** this is the html which was converted from the markdown to use in templates.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:** this is an example barebones template.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>{{ fsp["site_title"] }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {{ body }}
</body>
```
As you can see, you can access all of these by using double curly braces{{  }}.

## Custom Scripts
fsp has a feature for custom scripts that you can write which can be accessed in templates and markdown.
These scripts are written in python.

**Usage**

To use custom scripts, first go to config.toml, and add:
```toml
scripts_usage = true
```

Then, make a ***scripts.py*** file in the root directory.
The scripts.py file can be used anywhere in the md/html, via the `scripts` object.

Example:
```python
# scripts.py
def func():
    print("Hello from func()!")
```
and in markdown or html, you can call func() by doing:
```md
This is a message from func():
{{ scripts.func() }}
```

As you can see, any function or variable defined in scripts.py can be accessed.

## Robots and sitemaps
(note: i have literally no idea how these files work so i made these features based off of 5 minutes of googling, pls feel free to contribute!)

To use a robots.txt and sitemap.xml, simply include them in the `static` folder in the root directory (the same one where the rest of the static files are stored), and fsp will take care.
